=item C<part_picker NAME, VALUE, PARAMS>

All-in-one picker widget for parts. The name will be both id and name of the
resulting hidden C<id> input field. An additional dummy input will be generated
which is used to find parts. For a detailed description of it's behaviour, see
section C<PART PICKER SPECIFICATION>.

C<VALUE> can be an id or C<Rose::DB:Object> instance.

If C<PARAMS> contains C<type> only parts of this type will be used for
autocompletion. You may comma separate multiple types as in C<part,assembly>.

Obsolete parts will by default not displayed for selection. However they are
accepted as default values and can persist during updates. As with other
selectors though, they are not selectable once overridden.

Currently you must include C<js/autocomplete_part.js> in your controller, the
presenter can not do this from the template.
